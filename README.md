# Faction Player Filters (FPF)
## Descriptions
Adds various filters to pages with player lists such as hospital, jail, friends, blacklist, and faction pages along with the ability to auto-refresh all viewable players.

## FPF and Torn API Key usage
FPF **does not** require your API key to function.  If you choose to select the "AutoRefresh" feature on the filter bar, a new API field will appear below the filter bar and prompt for your Torn API key.

This API key is never transmitted anywhere else besides Torn's API or Torn-proxy.

Each script strictly adheres to the [Torn Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.torn.com/rules.php).
