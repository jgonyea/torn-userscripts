# Faction Player Filters (FPF)
## Descriptions
Adds various filters to pages with player lists such as hospital, jail, friends, blacklist, and faction pages.

## FPF and Torn API Key usage
FPF **does not** require your API key to function.

The icon within the filter bar links to my other webapp, [TornCAT](http://torncat.servegame.com).  If you saved your API key to your local cache with one of my other user scripts, FPF will transmit the API key along with the currently viewed player list to TornCAT to load.  See [TornCat's Privacy Policy](http://torncat.servegame.com/privacy.html) for more information on what I use the key for.

# Torn User Peek (TUP)
## Description
TUP adds a more detailed hover-tooltip on user badges by making one (1) API call per hover to the Torn API in order to pull that user's public information.

## TUP and Torn API Key usage
TUP **does** require your API key to function.  TUP prompts for your Torn API key, which is saved locally to your browser cache.  

Other TornCAT scripts, such as the TornCAT Faction Player Filters may leverage this saved data, but each script strictly adheres to the [Torn Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.torn.com/rules.php).
