# Faction Player Filters (FPF)
## Descriptions
Adds various filters to pages with player lists such as hospital, jail, friends, blacklist, and faction pages along with the ability to auto-refresh all viewable players.

## FPF and Torn API Key usage
FPF **does not** require your API key to function.  If you choose to select the "AutoRefresh" feature on the filter bar, a new API field will appear towards the top of the page.  This API key is never transmitted anywhere else besides Torn's API.

The icon within the filter bar links to my other webapp, [TornCAT](http://torncat.com), and will transmit the current filtered playerlist to TornCAT.  Your API key is never transmitted to TornCAT.

Each script strictly adheres to the [Torn Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.torn.com/rules.php).
